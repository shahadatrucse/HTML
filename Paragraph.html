        <p>No man is born corrupt. Family, social and surrounding environment have the greatest impact on human life. 
            So, corrupt people should be socially boycotted," he said yesterday at a programme on the occasion of International Anti-Corruption Day.<br>


            The programme was organised at the city's Shilapakala Academy yesterday morning, 
            where Chief Justice Syed Mahmud Hossain also delivered his speech as the special guest.<br>
            
            The theme of this year's Anti-Corruption Day is "Your right, your role: Say no to corruption".<br>
            
            The President said that honest, sincere and devoted people need to be evaluated socially.
             "Only then will corruption be reduced."<br>
